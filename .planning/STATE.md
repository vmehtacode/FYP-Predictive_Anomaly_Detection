# Grid Guardian — Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-26)

**Core value:** Detect anomalies in energy distribution networks without labeled data, using physics constraints and self-play learned patterns on graph-structured grid data
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - GNN Verifier Foundation

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 1 of 4
- **Plan:** 0 of 0 (not yet planned)
- **Status:** Not started
- **Progress:** [..........] 0%

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |

## Accumulated Context

### Technical Decisions
(None yet)

### Open Questions
- SSEN metadata schema for graph construction (needs exploration in Phase 1)
- Optimal GNN hyperparameters for 100K node graphs (will tune in Phase 1)

### Deferred Items
